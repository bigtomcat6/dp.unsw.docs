### 一、要求：

```moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au
Reflection 1: Reflective Video

Students will independently complete a short reflective video that addresses the following points:

o   What is your faculty and what do you know about it already? Why did you choose it?

o   What are your assumptions about University in Australia? What do you think the experience will be like?

o   What are your learning goals? What do you hope to achieve in your studies?

o   What are your expectations of the CAL course? How do you think it will support you in your other subjects?

Student should read the questions and reflect on their responses prior to making the video. Videos should be between 3 to 5 minutes in length. While this is a reflective piece, formal spoken conventions in line with university expectations must be used. Once the video is completed, submit it on Moodle.

Please save your video file with your ZID and full name.
