 Select one:

  - [ ] a. Current-controlled voltage source
  - [x] b. Current-controlled current source
  - [ ] c. Voltage-controlled current source
  - [ ] d. Voltage-controlled voltage source

</div>


##### Question 2


<div class="how_qb">

What is the total charge transferred over the time interval $0< t < 20
$, when $i(t) = \frac{1}{4}t A$?

Hint: Provide both the numerical answer in decimal format and the proper unit using standard SI unit symbols.

 Answer: ` 50C `


</div>

##### Question 3


<div class="how_qb">

The unit of current is:

Select one:

  - [ ] a. (V) Volt
  - [ ] b. (N) Newton
  - [ ] c. (J) Joule
  - [x] d. (A) Ampere



</div>


##### Question 4


<div class="how_qb">

What is the total charge through a point if the current through that point is given in the graph as below:

Hint: Make sure to choose the proper prefix for the charge unit in your answer from the available three options, i.e., micro-coulomb (uC), milli-coulomb (mC), or coulomb (C).

 Answer: ` 30 `  <select><option> uC </option></select>

</div>


##### Question 5


<div class="how_qb">

In the following figure, determine which elements generate power and which elements consume power.

Hint: You just need to drag either of "Consumes" or "Generates" words (given at the bottom of the circuit diagram) with your computer mouse and drop it below each element. A highlighted rectangular will show up as you drag the word to guide you where to drop it.
