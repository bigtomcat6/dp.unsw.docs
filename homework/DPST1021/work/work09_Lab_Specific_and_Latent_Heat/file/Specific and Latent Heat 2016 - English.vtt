00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.930
hello and welcome to the video about the

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.960
specific and matin heat laboratory

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.550
exercise in this laboratory exercise

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.310
you're going to be measuring the

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.910
specific heat of water and the latent

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.500
heat of fusion of ice so in order to

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.259
measure the specific heat of water

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.019
you're going to be submerging a small

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.710
heating element into a known amount of

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:42.390
water you're then going to be using your

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.960
power is equal to energy divided by time

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.720
relationship so P is it cool - its

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.750
energy but the energy is in the form of

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.710
heat in this case on time relationship

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:01.869
and the relationship between energy Q

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:04.239
heat energy and the specific heat M C

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:07.869
delta T which is the final temperature

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.830
minus the initial temperature in order

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.689
to find C the specific heat of water so

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.299
you'll know how much energy you've added

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.899
because you'll be able to measure the

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:23.890
amount of power going in using P is

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.630
equal to V I voltage times current we

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.499
should two quantities that you will be

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.060
measuring with your multimeter so this

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:33.850
is how you're going to do the first part

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.310
of the experiment in the second part

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.249
you're going to be measuring the latent

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.979
heat of fusion of ice so in this part

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.990
you're going to be submerging ice in

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.350
water and measuring the temperature

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.509
before and after the ice is melted and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.939
then using Q is equal to the mass of ice

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.670
times the latent heat of fusion and

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.159
you'll also be able to work out the heat

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.889
transfer by looking at the change in

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.840
temperature of the water around the ice

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:07.840
and considering the change in

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.509
temperature of the ice after it's melted

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.010
as well so let's have a look at the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.010
equipment that you'll be using now

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.560
this is the equipment that you'll be

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.410
using for this experiment you should set

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.690
your power supply to six volts using the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.420
little switch on the side you'll also

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.840
have two multimeters one is going to be

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.930
used as an ammeter for the ammeter you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.959
should use the unfused setting as the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.000
power output set around 2.5 amps and

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.360
this will blow the fuse if you use the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.120
fuse setting for the voltmeter use the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.920
fuse setting you'll also have a switch

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.830
because you don't want the current

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.019
flowing through your resistor when it's

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.989
not heating the water you'll have your

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.050
logger Pro with a temperature probe to

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.810
measure the temperature of the water and

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.930
you also have two kilometers one of

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.570
these Kalorama ters has a resist

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.640
resistor whether the little coil of wire

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.700
here which you'll use as a heating

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.070
element and the other has no resistor

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.080
you'll be using the second one to

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.080
measure the latent heat of fusion of ice

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:32.540
the calorimeter is just a aluminium can

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.120
surrounded by polystyrene polystyrene is

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.519
not a good thermal conductor so this is

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.299
going to insulate it and stop the heat

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.610
escaping out the site so in order to

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.040
start this experiment you're going to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.989
need to measure the mass of aluminium so

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.360
in order to do that carefully unscrew

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.690
the plastic top from the top of the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.579
aluminium stirrer being very careful to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.670
place it somewhere safe so that you

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.610
don't lose it

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.610
and then measure the mass of the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.190
aluminium can plus the stirrer on the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.450
scales which will be at the side of the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:15.500
lab record this mass and then use the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:21.130
tap at the side of the lab to fill your

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.130
Kalorama tucÃ¡n to about two-thirds full

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.870
you can then measure the mass again

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.970
either before or after collecting your

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.340
temperature measurements and from the

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.830
difference in the mass now and the mass

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.190
beforehand I can work out how much water

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.979
is in that color ometer so once you've

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.569
done that you're ready to start

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.569
recording your measurements

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.280
so you're going to need to set up your

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.280
circuit remember that the ammeter goes

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.860
in series with the resistor and the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.200
voltmeter needs to go in parallel across

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.090
it you need to measure the voltage in

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.300
the current in order to calculate the

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.700
power so may commit record of what these

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.610
are at the start of the five minutes

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.070
before as you heat the water and at the

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.070
end of the five minutes as well so let's

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.310
just quickly wire that up now I need my

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:36.480
power coming out of my power supply into

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:39.420
my switch then out of my switch into my

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:45.840
ammeter for which I'm using the unfused

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:50.510
setting out of my ammeter and into my

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:55.710
resistor and then out of my resistor

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:58.590
back into my power supply in a nice loop

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.620
so now the switch and the ammeter in

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.919
series with the resistor I now plug my

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.490
voltmeter in parallel across the

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.490
resistor

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.610
when your circuit parts set up leave the

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.620
switch open so that we're not currently

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.199
heating the water and set up the logger

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.770
Pro so the logger Pro remember needs

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:31.110
three attachments the power to the USB

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.870
at port at the back of the computer and

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.330
to the temperature probe you can switch

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.870
put the temperature probe through the

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.610
hole in the lid of the calorimeter make

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.040
sure that the temperature probe is only

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.940
touching the water and not touching the

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.789
aluminium sides of the Kalorama top once

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.880
that set up open the template on your

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:56.610
computer so go to experiments logger Pro

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:02.789
and then select select the specific and

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:07.110
latent heat experiment when you're ready

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:11.070
to collect the data open the sorry close

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:13.740
the switch press collect and then make

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:17.419
sure that you're continuously gently

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.500
stirring the water so that the water

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.229
inside the calorimeter

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.570
remains in thermal equilibrium

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:27.060
throughout the experiment when you just

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:30.800
start doing this record the voltage and

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.800
the current in your book

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.450
you

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.500
when you finished recording for five

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:01.880
minutes record the current and the

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.919
voltage in your lab manual switch off

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.960
the switch move it to the open position

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:08.800
so that the currents no longer flowing

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:12.290
through it and then stop recording on

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.960
your specific amount heat template on

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:17.720
the computer now you should have a nice

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.400
straight upwards trend what you're going

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:25.280
to need to do is fit a straight line to

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:28.190
that so highlight or the data from when

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.130
it was being heated and hit the straight

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:34.430
line tool at the top that's going to

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:36.409
give you the gradient for this line in

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.419
the theoretical problems you're going to

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:40.789
come up with a relationship between the

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.529
gradient of this line and the specific

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:44.779
heat of water so you may want to have a

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:48.890
think about that before you come to the

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:50.200
lab when you've done it for one sample

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.330
for five minutes

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.120
empty the water from the colorama tar

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:58.490
into the sink refill it with cold water

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.560
ever think about why you'd want to do it

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.779
with cold water instead of just

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.750
continuing to heat the already warm

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:07.970
water and repeat this at least another

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.880
two times so that you have three

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:13.910
measurements of CW from your gradient

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.800
and you can calculate an uncertainty in

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.800
your value for CW

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:26.079
in the second part of this experiment

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:28.779
you're going to be measuring the latent

00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:30.399
heat of fusion of ice you need to come

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:32.769
up with your own method to do this

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:35.380
you've got a separate calorimeter

00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:38.019
that you can use you've got water in the

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:42.430
tap it provides both warm and cold water

00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:45.639
you've got ice in the ice machine a hint

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:52.329
with this experiment is a good idea to

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:56.110
dry your ice cubes on a piece of paper

00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:59.259
towel before placing them into the

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:03.699
Kalorama Terr have a think about why

00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:05.889
you'd want to dry those ice cubes you

00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:08.319
can then use the temperature probe or

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:10.329
whatever you think is the best method to

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:12.399
measure the latent heat of fusion of ice

00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:14.199
make sure that you take enough

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:17.019
measurements so that you can also

00:10:14.199 --> 00:10:17.940
calculate on an uncertainty in your

00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:21.160
results

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:23.410
now with this equipment when you return

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.569
up to the hatch it's important that you

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.670
return it in the same state you got it

00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:30.220
so you're going to need to make sure

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:32.470
that you've dried everything with paper

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:37.600
towel please don't return the equipment

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:40.449
or wet make sure that the outside of the

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.540
polystyrene inside the calorimeter is

00:10:40.449 --> 00:10:45.399
dry okay thanks and I hope that you

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.149
enjoy and learn a lot from this

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:48.149
experiment

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.740
