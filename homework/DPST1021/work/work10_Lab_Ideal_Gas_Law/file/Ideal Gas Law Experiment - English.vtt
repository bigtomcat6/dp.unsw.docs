WEBVTT

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.740
before we start on the theory behind the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.140
ideal gas law experiment just a quick

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.200
warning that this experiment is quite

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.080
difficult it's designed to help you

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.500
practice some of the hardest part of the

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.230
thermal concepts of the thermal topic so

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.780
it's really important that you come well

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.110
prepared to the lab okay

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.239
so with that warning on to the theory so

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.989
in this experiment you're going to be

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.000
using the ideal gas law to start with

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.460
you're going to be placing masses on a

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.710
syringe so you'll have a syringe like

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.510
this one this is the syringe you'll be

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.309
using and you're going to be placing

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.250
masses on top of it now as you know from

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.980
physics 1a when you paste masses on

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.120
something there's a weight force so by

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.240
placing buttons up here you'll be

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.760
exerting a weight force on this plunger

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.730
here and you're going to be using this

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.670
to calculate and then you're going to

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.460
measure the pressure inside the syringe

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.460
so as hopefully you'll remember the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:33.250
pressure is equal to force over area and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.510
this area here is the cross sectional

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.690
area of the syringe so it's the area of

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:44.170
this surface here so you like to be able

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.450
to measure this in the lab because for

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.930
this syringe you'll be able to measure

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.820
the volumes and you also use your ruler

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.440
to measure the height and the volume

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.960
divided by the height is going to give

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.820
you the cross-sectional area for that

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:07.120
plunger so pressure equals force over

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.869
area in this case a force is applied by

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.150
the weight so when you add weight you'll

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.900
get a change in pressure and that will

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.110
equal mg on a where a is a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.120
cross-sectional area now one important

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.130
thing to remember is that we are in the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.450
lab and because the lab is on earth

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.870
we've got atmospheric pressure at

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.440
on us so the total pressure experienced

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:39.349
by the syringe is going to be in

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.630
atmospheric pressure which should be 1.0

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.600
1 times 10 to the 5 Pascal's but you'll

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.739
be able to measure it to check that plus

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:54.769
the additional pressure from the weight

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:56.900
force so in addition to this you're

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:03.670
going to be using the ideal gas law

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:06.769
which tells us that PV is equal to n R P

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.670
now in this first part of the experiment

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:14.720
you're going to fill the syringe up to

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.120
some initial volume and then you're not

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.730
going to let the air in or out after

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.580
you've done that so because the air is

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.000
not going in or out and the number of

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.120
moles will remain constant R the gas

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.070
constant is just a constant and with the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.010
temperature for this part you're

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.590
actually going to wait for the syringe

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.489
to come to thermal equilibrium with the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.970
surroundings

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.320
after you add each of the masses so the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.959
temperature is actually going to be

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.709
constant as well it's just going to be

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:53.720
the room temperature so we thought every

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:57.410
time here is constant so this will allow

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.090
us to use that PV is constant and so the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.700
initial pressure times the initial

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.820
volume is going to equal any final

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.070
pressure times final volume so you'll be

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.400
making use of this equation in the first

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.560
half of the experiment as well so that's

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.100
the theory that you're going to need for

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.100
Part 1

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.430
in part two of this experiment you're

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.000
going to be taking the gas inside the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.020
syringe through a cycle so first you're

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.810
going to be doing an adiabatic

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.630
compression then you'll have an iso

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.400
volumetric process where it's going to

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.730
be coming to thermal equilibrium with

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.160
the room and then you're going to do an

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.100
isothermal expansion where it's slowly

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.790
going to come back up to its initial

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.410
volume so in order to understand what's

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.600
going on there you're going to need to

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.960
understand what what each of the terms

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:11.550
that we've just used means so let's go

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:11.550
through them and adiabatic process

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:21.110
is one in which no heat is transferred

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:22.729
so q is equal to zero now how you're

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.409
going to achieve this in the lab is

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:29.509
you're going to compress it very quickly

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:31.580
so if you do something quickly then

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.080
there's no time for the heat to be

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:39.919
transferred and so Q is equal to zero

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.860
now for an adiabatic process the gas

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:46.309
also a beta closure and PV to the gamma

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:50.599
is equal to the constant so you would

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:54.680
have seen this in lecture where gamma is

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.300
equal to CP on TV the specific heat at

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.789
constant pressure and the specific heat

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.529
at constant volume and that is equal to

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:06.680
S Plus 2 on F where F is the number of

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.339
degrees of freedom now inside this

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.050
syringe

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:11.779
I've just got air because I've just

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.199
filled it up from the lab and air is

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:19.309
mainly comprised of nitrogen n2 and

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:23.930
oxygen o2 so an it's basically a

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:26.289
diatomic ideal gas so as you hopefully

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.059
know and diatomic gas at room

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.399
temperature has five degrees of freedom

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:34.430
it's got three translational degrees of

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:37.819
freedom and two rotational degrees of

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:41.749
freedom so at room temperature we've got

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:45.080
X is equal to five at room temperature

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:50.930
and pressure so this tells us that gamma

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:53.870
is equal to seven on five or 1.4 for air

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:57.529
at room temperature so you'll be using

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:00.830
this equation in the lab to describe

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:02.539
that idea basic process now another

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.089
process that you're going to be looking

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:07.389
at in this cycle is an isothermal

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:07.389
expansion

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:20.039
now all of part one was isothermal

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:21.569
because we were giving it time to come

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:24.449
to thermal equilibrium with the

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:28.409
surroundings so isothermal processes

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:30.840
tend to be slow because this allows time

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:33.629
for the heat to be transferred and for

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.960
everything to reach the surrounding

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:40.949
temperature so the equations that we

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:45.270
have that explain or describe isothermal

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:48.870
processes are we've got that there's no

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:52.139
changing temperature and so we know that

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:56.039
the constant internal energy is given by

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:58.289
F over two and our delta T and the

00:07:56.039 --> 00:08:00.810
temperature is not changing that is

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:03.360
going to be no change in the internal

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:06.120
energy now the other thing that we know

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.449
that we showed in part one was that PV

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:12.300
is equal to constant and that's because

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:15.539
n iron teeth are all not changing so

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.979
this is constant so the final process

00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:20.430
you're going to be doing in your cycle

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:21.900
is an ISO volumetric process where

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.219
you're just going to be letting it come

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.810
to thermal equilibrium with the

00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:28.849
surroundings without changing the volume

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.849
the ISO volumetric

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:40.110
is one in which the change in volume is

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:42.870
equal to zero and as we're not changing

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:46.260
the volume we're not doing any work on

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:49.470
the gap inside that syringe and so for

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:53.070
isovolumetric processes the work is

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:58.800
equal to zero and looking at the ideal

00:08:53.070 --> 00:09:04.350
gas law the V is constant so the equals

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:07.140
constant which is equal to NRT over the

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:11.970
pressure just rearranging the ideal gas

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:14.340
law so NR p on pressure is constant so

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:17.010
when you've measured everything for your

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.780
cycle your volumes your temperatures and

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.140
your pressures you're going to be

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:24.150
looking at how the first law of

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:28.070
thermodynamics applies in this case so

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.070
you'll also need to know your first law

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:41.319
which is just that the change in the

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:44.920
internal energy is equal to the heat

00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:48.550
transferred into the system plus the

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:51.339
work done on the system so you'll be

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:54.939
applying this to these different cases

00:09:51.339 --> 00:09:57.189
here do you know what the to zero in the

00:09:54.939 --> 00:09:59.949
isothermal process we know that the

00:09:57.189 --> 00:10:02.379
change in internal energy is 0 and in

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:05.009
the isovolumetric process we know that

00:10:02.379 --> 00:10:05.009
the work is zero

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:19.000
so for this experiment you're going to

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:21.579
need a ruler for measuring the height of

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.550
your syringe and the pencil for drawing

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:25.899
the graph of the cycle so please

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:30.220
remember to bring a ruler and a pencil

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:32.079
to the lab with you during this

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.250
experiment you're going to be using this

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:36.040
syringe here

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:38.800
you can read the volumes of the size of

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.290
the syringe at the bottom of the syringe

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.329
there's a temperature sensor

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.790
the temperature sensor is a thermocouple

00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:48.370
device which does take a very small

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.199
increment of time to come to thermal

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.360
equilibrium with the surroundings so

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:54.699
just keep that in mind when you are

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.070
measuring the temperature it's not an

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:59.290
instantaneous temperature it does take a

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.269
lot less than a second a very small

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.250
increment of time to read off the

00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:04.899
temperature so you're not actually going

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:08.529
to be able to measure the absolute

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:11.170
maximum temperature now to connect the

00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:13.060
temperature sensor you've got a cord at

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.459
the bottom of the syringe and you're

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:18.699
just going to plug that into this

00:11:15.459 --> 00:11:20.860
passport device and this will now be

00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:24.250
logging the temperature at the bottom of

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:27.250
that syringe now this syringe also has a

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:29.800
pressure sensor so that's connected to

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:33.819
the passport device through this tube

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.790
here now this device has a screw and

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:39.160
click mechanism it's really important

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:41.800
that you don't pull and yank this

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.800
connector here because that is going to

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:48.310
break the syringe so to connect this to

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:51.040
the passport device you just put it on

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.319
and then screw it round and you'll hear

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.870
a little click and it's then locked into

00:11:53.319 --> 00:11:58.449
place so that's a pressure sensor that

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.399
when you're putting air into or out of

00:11:58.449 --> 00:12:03.040
the syringe you need to have this

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:05.709
pressure sensor disconnected so that the

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.490
air can flow through it freely through

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:12.040
this tube here so once you've connected

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.019
this to the passport device you're then

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.050
going to need to connect the passport

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:19.959
device directly to the computer so it's

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:22.420
just got a USB cord that you will be

00:12:19.959 --> 00:12:24.550
plugging into the computer so let's have

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.170
a look now what happens when we plug it

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.970
into the computer so that we can get

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:31.360
the software all set up and ready to

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.940
record for this experiment you're going

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.950
to be using the capstone software you

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.769
open it up from the dock down the bottom

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:41.200
the icon is like a little pyramid so

00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:43.990
click on that to open it and then you'll

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.750
need to open the ideal gas law template

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:49.209
by going open experiment and choosing

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:52.180
the ideal gas law from within the

00:12:49.209 --> 00:12:53.949
physics 1a experiment folder when you've

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.630
done that you should see an absolute

00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:57.699
pressure versus time graph and

00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.190
temperature versus time graph on your

00:12:57.699 --> 00:13:02.230
screen when you're ready to record data

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:05.350
you'll hit the little red record button

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.089
down in the bottom left-hand corner so

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:12.220
let's see how to get ready to record

00:13:07.089 --> 00:13:14.079
that data now so for Part one of the

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.139
experiment you're going to need 60

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:19.779
milliliters of air inside the syringe so

00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:23.290
we'll make sure that the pressure sensor

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:26.320
is disconnected pull the plunger up - it

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:29.380
measures 60 milliliters and then connect

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:38.350
the pressure cents off back to the

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:41.290
syringe now we're going to be placing

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.630
masses on this syringe so we need the

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:46.959
syringe to be nice and stationary so

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:49.959
with the both head and clamp clamp the

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:53.440
syringe with the base of the syringe

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:55.660
flat on the cork map you don't need to

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.089
clamp it too tightly this is just to

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.920
provide a bit of stability so that it

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:04.120
doesn't wobble about as we're taking the

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.800
measurements now before we start with

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.500
not going to need to get some initial

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.640
measurements so that we know what the

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.850
atmospheric pressure or at least the

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.760
pressure inside that syringe are so you

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:20.769
can now press the collect button on your

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:25.389
computer or the Start button and this

00:14:20.769 --> 00:14:26.680
will start collecting the data so now

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:29.260
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:32.260
press paste some masses on top of the

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:34.930
syringe to start applying that force and

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.149
changing the pressure so it's to start

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:40.480
with we're going to add one and a half

00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:43.760
kilos to the syringe

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.040
so we're going to need the 500 gram mass

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:53.210
hold off with two of these 500 gram

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:55.310
masses on it now with this experiment

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:58.070
it's really important that everything is

00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:00.050
carefully aligned vertically we don't

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:02.810
want these masses applying any side

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:06.520
woods force onto the syringe we want

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:09.140
everything vertically up and down and

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:12.080
again with this clamp at the top this is

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:14.420
not actually to hold these masses it's

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.580
just to provide some stability and stop

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.220
them falling off the clamp so this is

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:23.300
just resting on the top there so that

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:25.730
the entire 1.5 kilograms is applying a

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.670
weight force downwards so just make sure

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:32.120
that everything is nicely aligned

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:34.670
vertically now it's going to take a very

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.500
short time for this syringe to come to

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.080
thermal equilibrium with the room

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:43.130
temperature and you'll be able to see

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.990
when that has happened on your

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.140
temperature graph because you're going

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:50.030
to get a little blip when you put the

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:52.700
masses on and then it's going to return

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.290
nicely to the room temperature so those

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.860
doesn't be the measurement that you'll

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:59.800
want to be taking for this part you can

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.570
measure the pressure and temperature

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.640
later but as you're going it's really

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:07.010
important that you read the volumes off

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.770
the sides of the syringe and record

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:12.920
these next to the masses in the book so

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:16.850
when I've got 1.5 kilograms on there my

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:20.660
syringe is measuring 49 milliliters so I

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:22.850
would write that down so once you've

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.980
recorded the volume and it's returned to

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:28.820
their moral ibrahim you can add the next

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:31.340
mass on you'll get a little blip in the

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.380
temperature again just wait until it

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.210
returns to the room temperature because

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.100
remember if we're making the assumption

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:39.470
that this is isothermal at this point

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:42.260
and then once it's returned to the room

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:45.050
temperature read off the volume in my

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:48.140
case that's 46 milliliters and record

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:51.020
that in your book you keep on doing this

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.529
until all the masses have been added to

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.999
your system you

00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:58.699
at time to return to thermal equilibrium

00:16:53.999 --> 00:17:01.470
and recording the volume every time

00:16:58.699 --> 00:17:04.049
now that you've recorded your data it's

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:06.179
time to analyze it so you should have

00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:09.419
graphs on the screen which look a lot

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:12.630
like this now what we need to do is get

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:13.949
the mean value of the pressure in each

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.919
of these regions

00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:19.049
and measure the temperature when once

00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:21.390
it's recur return to thermal equilibrium

00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:23.669
as well so to do that it gives little

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.250
highlighter button and then we need to

00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:28.140
adjust the size of the box and then

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:31.289
we'll drag it to the area that we're

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.419
interested in so this here shows me the

00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:35.820
initial pressure this was before I added

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:38.850
any masses so to get the value for that

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.950
I then once I've put my box over it I

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:43.049
hit the little Sigma button which gives

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:45.179
me the statistics so this will tell me

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:47.400
the mean I can choose other statistics

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:50.220
if I want but what I'm interested in is

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.140
the mean so what I can do is I could

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.330
move this box around to each of these

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.179
places or I can create a new box

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:59.610
whichever one you prefer for each region

00:17:57.179 --> 00:18:02.070
so now it's got the box we put it on

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:05.220
here and this is when I added 1.5

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:07.169
kilograms so let's just get it to

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.720
thermal equilibrium and then hit the

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:12.179
statistics button for that box and it

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.490
tells me that the mean is 124 point

00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:17.280
eight so I would then record that in my

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:19.830
box next to the in my book sorry next to

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.720
the one point five kilograms now I just

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.760
do need to check this we come to a

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.149
somewhat query on each time I expect

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.730
these temperatures to be the same so I

00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:32.700
create the boxes over here as well

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:36.780
here's the temperature before I added

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:38.789
any masses so get the statistics on that

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.370
and then you can see the blip when I

00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:43.799
added the masses what I'm interested in

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:47.159
is a bit after it's returned to thermal

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:49.470
equilibrium so that shows this box and

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:52.289
put it there and just make it fit you

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:54.179
know get the statistics for that box

00:18:52.289 --> 00:18:56.549
thirty point three five so you can see

00:18:54.179 --> 00:18:59.909
it is returning to pretty much the same

00:18:56.549 --> 00:19:02.580
temperature like it was meant to so fill

00:18:59.909 --> 00:19:04.120
out that table in your book and then you

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:09.820
can answer the questions

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:12.580
about what happened in part two of this

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:15.340
experiment you're going to be taking the

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.530
air inside the cylinder through a cycle

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.560
so to do this you're going to need to

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:23.680
push down quickly so remove the syringe

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.780
from the clamp now for this part you're

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.030
going to need 40 milliliters of air in

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.710
the syringe so remember to change the

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:32.410
volume of the air you need to disconnect

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:36.040
the pressure sensor compress the syringe

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:45.790
down to 40 milliliters and then put the

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:48.730
pressure sensor back in so now it's all

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:50.260
connected up at 40 milliliters what

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.330
you're going to do is an adiabatic

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.760
compression so a quick compression

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.170
you're then going to hold it down there

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.170
while it comes to thermal equilibrium

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:02.110
with the surrounds and then you're going

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.730
to very slowly let it come back up and

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:06.490
while you're doing that you're going to

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:08.500
try and keep the temperature constant so

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:12.130
before you start the process remember to

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:14.740
collect the data press start then quick

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:16.840
compression hold it there while it comes

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.550
to thermal equilibrium which you will

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:23.650
see on your temperature graph it will

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:26.790
level off and go horizontal once it's

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:29.880
horizontal let it go up very slowly

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:33.870
trying to keep the temperature line as

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.870
horizontal as possible

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:48.309
if you'd end up returning to the 40

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.309
milliliters as it started
