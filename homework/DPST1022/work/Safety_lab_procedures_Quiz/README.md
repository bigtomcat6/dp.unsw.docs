Wearing a mask is mandatory in the first year physics lab as at some times during the lab a demonstrator will have to approach the. The videos below show you how to correctly put on a mask.

P2 mask:

##### Question 12

<div style="background-color:#f3f7f9">
<div style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px">

**Laboratory rules and procedures:**

**Covered Shoes**
If you are not wearing correct shoes you will not be permitted to enter the lab. In this case you should do the online version of the lab exercise.

**Being late**
If you are 10 minutes late to your lab class, you will not be permitted to work in the lab. In this case you should do the online version of the lab exercise.

**Finish work 15 mins before the end of the lab**
Everyone is required to finish their work 15 minutes before the end of the lab. At this time you will be required to present your laboratory manual for marking and pack up and clean your equipment.

**Plagiarism**
Copying data is plagiarism. If you come to the lab with data already written in your lab manual you will get zero for that lab. There is no reason to bring data into the lab. If you bring someone else's completed lab manual to the lab you will get zero and so will the owner of the lab manual.

**Getting marked**
Fill out your name and student number under the tick boxes on the marking guideline at the beginning of the lab session. As you finish each part of the experiment you should get marked off.

**Moodle**
At the end of your lab the demonstrator will record your mark. Make sure that this is done. You should be able to view your mark on Moodle before your next lab session. If you can not see your mark please talk with your lecturer.

**Asking demonstrators questions**
You do not lose marks for asking demonstrators questions. They are there to help you. The labs are a good opportunity to ask people about physics. Do not leave your questions until the end of the lab, they should be asked before the last 15 minutes, demonstrators will need to mark people off quickly at the end.

**Food, drink and phones**
You can not eat or drink in the first year physics lab or use your mobile phone or iPad. Please leave food, drink or mobile devices in your bag.  If you need a calculator we will lend you one.

**Legal requirement for a safety induction**

UNSW is legally required to do a safety induction for everyone who is using a laboratory space on campus.

What will happen 15 minutes prior to the end of your laboratory session?
</div>

</div>

  Select one:

  - [ ] You should continue working, it is very important to finish the lab exercise. 
  - [ ] You have another 5 minutes to complete the lab exercise so you need to hurry up.
  - [x] **You must stop work, return all equipment and hand in your lab manual to be marked.**


##### Question 13


<div style="background-color:#f3f7f9">
<div style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px">

</div>

  Select one:

  - [ ] Full marks: you have prepared well and will be rewarded.
