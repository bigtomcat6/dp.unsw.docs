### Introduction to Online Tutorials


##### Question 1

<div class="how_qb">



Welcome to Mathematics 1B.

Online Tutorials sit between lectures and classroom tutorials. They are designed to:

 * keep you up to date with the course,
 * ensure you understand fundamental content, and
 * expand your understanding from lectures in ways that are not available in a traditional classroom.

Interactive GeoGebra apps allows you to visualise complex calculations, and the "How did I do?" button allows you to instantly verify your understanding. There is no penalty or limit on the number of times you can press the "How did I do?" button, so use it often.

 - [x] okay, got it
 - [ ] tl;dr.


</div>




##### Question 2

<div class="how_qb">


Maple TA is a centrally managed system that is part of the TELT platform (Technology Enabled Learning and Teaching).

If you encounter a technical problem with Maple TA you should report it to the IT Service Centre by phone or email.  Examples of such problems are:

 * can't log in to Maple TA;
 * a java error message was displayed;
 * the server is not responding.

If you encounter a problem that is to do with a particular question or test in your Maple TA class, you should contact your course Maple TA contact as listed in the course outline.

 

For each item below select the appropriate contact to report the problem.

 - <select><option checked> IT Service Centre </option><select> I can't log in to Maple TA.

 - <select><option checked> IT Service Centre </option><select> The Maple TA server is not responding and appears to be down.

 - <select><option checked> Counse Maple TA contact </option><select> I was marked wrong in a question but I think my answer was correct.

 - <select><option checked> Counse Maple TA contact </option><select> According to the course outline, the online test should be available but I can't find it. 


</div>



##### Question 3

<div class="how_qb">


If you click on the "Quit and Save" button then MapleTA will Save, and then Quit (in that order). You can come back to the assignment later. All your hard work will still be there.

But you should only click "Submit Assignment" when you are <select><option checked> finished </option><select> .


There is no limit to the number of attempts you can take, MapleTA will only record your best attempt.

</div>



##### Question 4

<div class="how_qb">


At the top right of the page, you will see your Current Grade. This gets updated when you navigate to another page using the "Back","Question Menu" or "Next" buttons.

By using the "How did I do?" button and the "Current Grade", you should have a very clear idea about the marks you will get for each Online Tutorial.

Your marks for an Online Tutorial are visible on the Mathematics 1B homepage after the <select><option checked> due date </option><select> .

Once you are confident that you have 5 out of 5 (you need at least 4 out of 5 before you can attempt your Online Tutorials) click on "Submit Assignment".

</div>

### Using Maple TA

##### Question 1

<div class="how_qb">


Some assessements in Maple TA are only available for a restricted time period.  The Maple TA class homepage displays the starting and ending dates for these assessments.  The date is shown in the format set by your browser.  If you language is not set to "English/Australia", the dates shown by Maple TA might use the "English/United States" convention.

For more information, see the Maple TA help page:

 * [Maple TA help](http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/currentstudents/maple-ta)


  - [x] OK

 </div>


##### Question 2

<div class="how_qb">


Many tests in Maple TA have a time limit.  Please read the important points below regarding timed tests.

 
 * Before starting a test, you can check whether it has a time limit by click on the "policies" link to the right of the test link on your Maple TA class homepage.
 * When you click on the link to start a test for which the grade is recorded (ie it is not just for practice), you will be given a warning that the clock can NOT be stopped once you start the test.  If you are not ready to commit to completing the test at that time, you should click "Cancel".
 * The test timer clock starts as soon as you begin the test, NOT when you answer the first question.
 * During a timed test, such as this one, you should be able to see a clock counting down the time near the top right corner of the test window.  If you can not see that clock now, your computer may have a Java version that is incompatible with Maple TA.
 * Once you have started a test, nothing will stop the count down timer for the test.
 * It is your responsibility to make sure that you will not be interrupted during your attempt.  For example, if you are using a computer lab on campus, be aware that the it may be booked for a class in the following hour.
 * The following do NOT stop the test clock:
   - closing the test window;
   - logging out of Maple TA;
   - logging out of a lab computer;
   - clicking "Quit and Save".


Select ALL of the following statements that are TRUE.

 - [x] Once a test has begun, nothing will stop the test clock.
 - [x] If you are interrupted during at attempt at a test, you will NOT be given an additional attempt.
 - [ ] The test clock starts after you have answered the first question.
 - [ ] Clicking "Quit and Save" stops the test clock.
 - [x] Closing the test window before attempting any questions WILL count as an attempt.

### MapleTA Syntax

##### Question 1

<div class="how_qb">


Enter the expression $e^{-8x}$ in the answer box below.

You will need to type in exp(-8*x).

Check your input by using the preview button (the magnifying glass). Notice that the preview does not work properly here.


 ` exp(-8*x) `

</div>


##### Question 2

<div class="how_qb">


Enter the complex number

 $2+5i$

in the box below.

Note:

 - The imaginary unit i (ie $\sqrt{-1}$ ) is entered as "I" (capital i).
 - All multiplications require a "*" (asterisk).


 ` 2+5*I `

 </div>


##### Question 3

<div class="how_qb">


Enter

$\frac{\sqrt{6}i sin(\frac{3}{7} \pi) e^{4x}}{x^2+4}$

in the box below.

Hints:

 * You must use a "*" (asterisk) for all mulitplications.
 * $e^{4x}$  is entered as "exp(4*x)".
 * π is entered as "Pi".
 * $\sqrt{6}$ is entered as "sqrt(6)" or "(6)^(1/2)".
 * The imaginary unit i (ie $\sqrt{-1}$ ) is entered as I (capital i).
 * Don't forget brackets where necessary!
 * Here the preview is the word "Preview" under the answer box. Due to the exponential in the answer the preview is again not much use!


 ` (sqrt(6)*I*sin(3/7*Pi)*exp(4*x))/(x^2+4) `

 </div>


##### Question 4

<div class="how_qb">


 To enter a vector in Maple TA, use Maple's < > notation.

 For example, enter the vector

$$\begin{pmatrix}
   1 \\
   2 \\
   7
\end{pmatrix}$$

by typing

$$<1,2,-7>$$

in the box below.

 ` <1,2,-7> `

Notice that the preview link does not work properly in this case.

</div>

##### Question 5

<div class="how_qb">


To enter a matrix in Maple TA, use Maple's << >> notation.

For example, enter the matrix

$$\begin{pmatrix}
   1 & -4 & 6 \\
   3 & 10 & \pi
\end{pmatrix}$$

by typing

$$<<1|-4|6>,<3|10|Pi>>$$

or

$$<<1,3>|<-4,10>|<6,Pi>>$$

in the box below.

 ` <<1|-4|6>,<3|10|Pi>> `


Notice that the preview link does not work properly in either case.
